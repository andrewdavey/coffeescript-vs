Warning: This project is a work in progress and not yet ready for real-world use.

[CoffeeScript](http://jashkenas.github.com/coffee-script/) is great. Let's add Visual Studio support for the language. Initially some basic syntax highlighting would be enough!

You will need the [Visual Studio 2010 SDK](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/en/details.aspx?FamilyID=47305cf4-2bea-43c0-91cd-1b853602dcc5&displaylang=en) to work with this project.
